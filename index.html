      <p>  The premise of Figs has always wildly baffled me, whether it's their texture, taste, or the fact that for most natural breeds of fig, in order for it to become ripe a wasp must crawl in, die, and deteriorate... strangely doesn't sound all that appetizing to me. Here's the three reasons for why I personal think <mark>figs are a fruit that should just stay as a nice looking tree</mark>, and be put in cookie's to make them into mediocre cookies.</p>

    I mean just look at this. Despite it literally looking like the inside of a demogorgon, the physical texture feels like chewing on a rotting cat tongue. The outside skin is hairy, but not in the way a peach is, and rather feels more like a teenage boy's mustache. Overall a clearly unpleasant expeirence texture wise.

    Truly an awful premise of a food. The only "food" I find myself relating this awful taste to is pepto bismol, which makes me vomit when it even simply touches my lips. If you truly wish to gag from something rancid, I suggest you try a fig or fig newton, in which the fig completely ruins what could had just been a decent cookie.

    Despite the fact that not all figs need the wasp to crawl in and die in order to become ripe, if I try to eat a fig, one with no wasp fertalization, I will still be thinking of a wasp rotting in a fruit as I eat, which is something I'm sure most people would love to not think about when putting something in their body.

  In conclusion, I hate Figs.
