      <p1>  The premise of Figs has always wildly baffled me, whether it's their texture, taste, or the fact that for most natural breeds of fig, in order for it to become ripe a wasp must crawl in, die, and deteriorate... strangely doesn't sound all that appetizing to me. Here's the three reasons for why I personal think figs are a fruit that should just stay as a nice looking tree, and be put in cookie's to make them into mediocre cookies.</p1>
